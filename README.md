Thia ia an Bill splitter application build using Vue.

This is a challenge from the frontend mentor and I have completed using Vue. In this app you add the total bill and select the tip you want to give, If the tip is listed then you can simply select one or else you can also insert the custopm percentage to tip. You also need to add the the number of people then the display on the right show the splitted amount.

Here I tried to create the component to express the knowledge of mine that i can build the component and work on the vue application,.

Some small details are also taken care in this app like, no negative number, error with red color and more.

It is fully responsive so you can use it as send me the feedback.
Thank you for reading about this application.
